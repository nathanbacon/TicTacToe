# TicTacToe

This project is used to demonstrate the process of creating an iMessage app from a standalone app. It's just a simple TicTacToe
game, if you could even call it a game, as it can't detect wins as of yet. However, it's good enough to learn a little about 
iMessage app extensions.

## Setup

To run this, clone or download the repository. Open the project by clicking the TicTacToeApp.xcodeproj or by typing:

open TicTacToeApp.xcodeproj

Then next to the play and stop button, there's a button that shows either TicTacToeApp or TicTacToeMessage as in the screenshot
below. Click and hold that to select your target, one's the standalone app and the other's the iMessage app.

## Credits

Lots of credit goes to Apple's demo app for Messages. Some code segments were blatantly lifted from that but a good part of this is unique and covers a few things Apple's demo doesn't. Their demo is really good and can be found at the link below.
